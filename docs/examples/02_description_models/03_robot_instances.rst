COMPAS Fab provides several ready-to-use Robot packages that can be used for
demonstrating the capabilities of the package. These packages can be accessed from the
`compas_fab.robots.RobotLibrary` class. The robot packages are loaded from local data
files located in the folder `src/compas_fab/data/robot_library`. They contain
the `robot.model`, `robot.semantics` and meshes associated with the robot links.

The robot packages can be used with the PyBullet Planning backends for planning purpose and
without backend for visualization purpose. The robot packages will be extended in the future
to work with the ROS MoveIt planning backend.

The following packages are available:

Origin of the packages
======================

The robot packages originates from ROS MoveIt Robot Packages located in
`gramaziokohler/ros_docker <https://github.com/gramaziokohler/ros_docker/>`_.
The docker files are *composed up* and extracted over ROS to a local folder structure
that is compatible with the COMPAS Fab package. The convertion script can be found in the
source code repository folder `scripts/extact_robot_package_from_ros.py`.
